# Frontend (React - Vite)

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) to see the Hello World page.

Note: If you prefer Create React App instead of Vite, you can replace this scaffolding accordingly.

Auth demo
1. Start the backend (see Backend/README.md). Make sure it's running at http://localhost:5000
2. Start the frontend dev server (or use the static `hello.html` fallback)
3. Use the register form to create a user, then login. After login you'll see a protected hello message returned by the backend.
