# Frontend (React - Vite)

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) to see the Hello World page.

Note: If you prefer Create React App instead of Vite, you can replace this scaffolding accordingly.
